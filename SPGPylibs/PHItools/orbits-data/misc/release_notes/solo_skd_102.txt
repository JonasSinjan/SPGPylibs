      Frames Kernels:

        - Updated SWA EAS reference frames

        - Corrected SOLO_SUN_RTN frame definition and updates
          names and IDs for the cross-mission heliophysics frames.

        - Included New Norcia station topographic frame.

      Instrument Kernels:

        - Updated SWA EAS FoV defintions according to the new science
          frames definitions.

      CK Kernels:

        - Added test Roll CK kernel.

      SPK Kernels:

        - Included New Norcia PSK.


   March 28, 2018 v0.4.0

      This release has been motivated in order to provide a SPICE scenario
      for the ``Low Latency Pipeline 'Test Card' Data'' test. The current
      SPICE Kernel Dataset covers the two scenarios:

        - Scenario 1: Perihelion, Disk Centre Pointing
          [2022-03-31T00:02:47Z - 2022-04-01T00:02:46Z]

        - Scenario 2: Maximum Southern Latitude, Near-Limb Pointing
          [2022-03-03T00:02:44Z - 2022-03-04T00:02:43Z]

      Instrument Kernels:

         - Updated smaller typos and descriptions.

         - Remote sensing sensors FOV frames corrected from SOLO_*_ILS to
           SOLO_*_OPT.

      SPK kernels:

         - Generated SPK for 2018 Option-E candidate trajectory.

      CK kernels:

         - Generated Default roll attitude for 2018 Option-E trajectory

         - Generated Pitch-Yaw attitude for Scenario 2 with:

             Spacecraft Pitch 15 Arcminutes
             Spacecraft Yaw   20 Arcminutes

      SCLK kernels:

         - Generated a ``real'' SCKL with its origin at
           2000-01-01T00:00:00Z.


   October 19, 2017 v0.3.0

      Frames Kernel:

         - Reviewed by SOLO SOC (Christopher Watson). Updated references and
           descriptions.

         - Corrected SOLO_SOLOHI_ILS and SOLO_EPD_EPT definitions and
           descriptions.

         - Renamed the Spacecraft Physical reference frame "SOLO_PRF"
           (the Airbus definition, which becomes unknowable in-flight) to
           Spacecraft Reference Frame "SOLO_SRF" (what is in the FITS
           definitions).

         - Added inboard and outboard segments of the instrument boom.

      CK kernels:

         - Generated V02 of all the CK files due to the frame name update
           SOLO_PRF -> SOLO_SRF.

         - Removed 'solo_ANC_soc-sc-boom-ck_20180930-21000101_V01.bc' for
           now the INS_BOOM has two separate CK frames.

      MK kerneks:

         - Renamed MKs (removed 'default' from the filename)

      Instrument Kernels:

         - EPD: Renamed and added sensor definitions SOLO_EPD_HET_MY
           and SOLO_EPD_HET_PY.

         - METIS: Reviewed by SOLO SOC (Christopher Watson). Corrected
           FoV definition.

         - SPICE: Reviewed by SOLO SOC (Christopher Watson). Corrected
           FoV definition.

         - STIX: Reviewed by SOLO SOC (Christopher Watson). Corrected
           FoV definition.


   July 6, 2017 v0.2.0

      Frames kernel partially reviewed by SOLO SOC (Andrew Walsh)
      Added Science frame kernel and STR instrument kernel.

      Please note that this release is the first public release of the
      Solar Orbiter Kernel Dataset.


   May 19, 2017 v0.1.0

      Initial release of the Solar Orbiter SPICE Kernel dataset. This release
      incorporates an initial draft of the kernels updated and corrected
      during coordination meetings in between the ESA SPICE Service and the
      Solar Orbiter SOC (Marc Costa Sitja, Andrew Walsh and Chris Watson).
      This iterations are reflected in the Minutes of Meeting of the
      ESS-SOLO coordination meetings that took place until the release date.

      Please note that this release has not been publicly released on the
      FTP but distributed internally to the SOLO SOC by the ESA SPICE
      Service.
